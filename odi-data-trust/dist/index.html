Trust allows us to reveal ourselves. Trust implies a fair exchange.</p><p>UX interfaces seek to lull us into a sense of security, a panacea of trust, a green lock in the corner of the eye. There is no fair exchange with the custodians of our data.</p><p>How can we re-establish reciprocity of trust? What does procedural trust look like? Under what conditions would you share your data with me?</p><h2>Proposal</h2><p>A period of researching different codes of creating trust, both theoretical and with different focus groups.</p><p>Seek to translate those codes to a technological domain as an interactive installation.</p><p>Imagine / prototype tools for alerting people of a breach of trust, or providing a haptic or sensory warning when about to share data in an unsafe manner. A transferable credit of trust in the hands of the people.</p><h2>About me</h2><ul><li>I've been a practising artist in the media arts field for five years.
